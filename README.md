# About
Vimage is a console-based image manipulator with a Vim-style user interface.

Vimage uses character block graphics to display and edit JPEGs, PNGs, and BMPs in 24-bit truecolor where possible. Windows and Linux consoles support truecolor out of the box. "Terminal" built in to macOS only supports an 8-bit color display but iTerm2 on macOS supports truecolor.

Vimage focuses on general image manipulations such as resizing, cropping, flipping, rotating, splitting, and joining. It does not currently offer pixel-level editing.

`:aspect-fill` | `[WxH\|Wx\|xH]`     | Crops, expands, and/or resizes the current image to aspect-fill the specified size, retaining the same aspect ratio while completely filling the specified dimensions. Some content may be lost.
`:aspect-fit`  | `[WxH\|Wx\|xH]`     | Crops, expands, and/or resizes the current image to aspect-fit the specified size, retaining the same aspect ratio while fitting all content within the specified dimensions. The result may be letterboxed or pillarboxed.
`:bg`       | `[V\|RGB\|ARGB\|RRGGBB\|AARRGGBB]`<br>`[t\|transparent\|white\|red\|...\|random]` | Sets the background color used for `:new` images and for expanded areas of an existing image.
`:channel` | `<operation-name> [ARGS]` | Manipulates the color channels. Refer to the [Channel Operations](#Channel-Operations) table for more information.
`:crop`     | `WxH` `[t|l|b|r]*` | Crop/expand to size WxH (e.g. `:crop 640x480`). If W and H are real numbers then they are treated as proportions - `:crop 0.5x2.0` crops half the width and expands to twice the height. An optional anchor may be specified.
`:crop`     | `Wx` `[c|t|l|b|r]*` | Crop/expand to width W, preserving the current height. Optional second arg is anchor, e.g. 'center', 't' or 'tl'. ':anchor' setting is used if anchor arg not supplied.
`:crop`     | `xH` `[c|t|l|b|r]*` | Crop/expand to height H, preserving the current width. Optional second arg is anchor, e.g. 'center', 't' or 'tl'. ':anchor' setting is used if anchor arg not supplied.

`:crop`     | `LEFT TOP RIGHT BOTTOM` | Crop/expand the specified number of pixels on each side. `:crop 1 -2 0 1` crops the left and bottom by 1 pixel and expands the top by 2 pixels.
`:extract`  | `a<255,r==0,...` | Extracts all the pixels from the current image to a new image that match the specified color component range. Operator `=` is the same as `==` and `!=` is not supported.
`:fill` | `COLOR`\<br>`TOP BOTTOM`<br>`TL TR BL BR`<br>`COLORS` | Fills the current image with a single color, a color gradient that uses either 2 top and bottom colors or 4 corner colors, or a horizontal color gradient that uses 3, 5, or more colors.
`:fillalpha` | `COLOR`\<br>`TOP BOTTOM`<br>`TL TR BL BR`<br>`COLORS` | Similar to ':fill' except preserves rgb values and only fills alpha color.
`:fillrgb` | `COLOR`\<br>`TOP BOTTOM`<br>`TL TR BL BR`<br>`COLORS` | Similar to ':fill' except preserves alpha values and only fills RGB color.
`:filter` | `<filter-name> [ARGS]` | Applies an image filter. Refer to the [Filters](#Filters) table for more information.

`:join`     | `WxH blend [<percent>%|<pixels>] [wrap]` | Join or splice the next W\*H images together in a WxH grid. The tile seams are blended together by the specified amount (default 25%). If 'wrap' is specified then the last tile is blended into the first tile.
`:name`     | `<filename>`      | Renames the current image but does not save the renamed image.
`:new`      | `WxH`             | Creates a new image of the specified pixel size, inserting it below the current image.
`:NEW`      | `WxH`             | Like `:new` but inserts the result ABOVE the current image.
`:open`     | `<filepaths>`     | Opens one or more specified images and adds them to the Image List.
`:q`        |                 | Quits (closes) the current image. Will be unsuccessful if the image has modifications.

`:qq`       |                 | Quits all images and ends Vimage. Will be unsuccessful if any image has modifications.
`:qq!`      |                 | Quits all images, even if some of them have modifications.
`:resize`   | `[WxH\|Wx\|xH]`     | Resizes the current image. "Wx" and "xH" variations retain the current aspect ratio while specifying a new size for one dimension.
`:rm`       |                 | Removes (deletes) the file for the current image from the filesystem. Useful for cleaning up an image folder by deleting unwanted images.

`:shift`    | `X Y [wrap|w]`    | Shifts the image. The current ':bg' color is used for shifted-in pixels.
`:split`    | `WxH`             | Splits the current image into W\*H images. For example, `:split 4x2` assumes the current image is 4 tiles wide and 2 tiles high and splits the image into 8 separate tile images.
`:split`    | `patch`           | Auto-determines whether image has a sizing guide only on the top (font strip) or on all four sides (9-patch image) and then splits the image into its separate tiles.
`:trim`     | `[t|l|b|r]`       | Trims fully transparent pixels from the specified sides, or all sides if none specified.

# Channel Operations

    :channel <operation-name> [ARGS]

Operation Name    | Arguments  | Description
---------------|------------|------------
copy           | `[a\|r\|g\|b\|XX]` `[a\|r\|g\|b]+` | Copy the specified source channel (a,r,g,b) or a constant channel value (such as `7f`) to one or more destination channels. To copy red to green and blue channels: `:channel copy r gb`. See also: `:channel swap`.
hsvtorgb       | &nbsp;     | The corollary to `:channel rgbtohsv`, this assumes the current image contains HSV color components and converts them to RGB color components.
rgbtohsv       | &nbsp;     | Converts the current image's RGB color components into HSV (Hue Saturation Value, also called HSB or Hue Saturation Brightness) color components. Each pixel's "red" value now indicates hue (0-255), "green" is saturation (0-255), and "blue" is brightness (0-255). These channels can be further manipulated using commands such as `:&`, `:|`, and `:clamp`. Then the image can be converted back into RGB with the command `:channel hsvtorgb`.
swap           | `[a\|r\|g\|b]` `[a\|r\|g\|b]` | Swaps one color channel with another. For example, `:channel swap r b` swaps the red and blue channels. See also: `:channel copy`.

# Filters

Filter Name    | Arguments  | Description
---------------|------------|------------
brightgold     | &nbsp;     | Map max(R,G,B) to gradient [Black,Orange,Yellow,White]
clamp          | `LOCOLOR HICOLOR` | Limits the range of each pixel's color components to the corresponding low and high byte of the specified ARGB values. For example, `clamp 048 FCA` limits each red component to the range 00-FF, each green component to 44..CC, and each blue component to 88..AA.
gold           | &nbsp;       | Map gray(R,G,B) to gradient [Black,Orange,Yellow,White]

normalize      | [low high] (defaults: 0 255) | Normalizes brightness. The existing brightness range is remapped onto the full brightness range 0..255 or other specified range.
seamless       | `[h|v] [<percent>% | <pixels>]` | Creates a seamless tile by splitting and transposing halves, adding a translucency gradient, and merging back over the original image. Optionally specify e.g. '50%' to edge-blend just 50% of the image or e.g. '50' to edge-blend just 50 pixels. Optionally specify 'h' for horizontal only, 'v' for vertical only.
