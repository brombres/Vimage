# About
Vimage is a console-based image manipulator with a Vim-style user interface.

Vimage uses character block graphics to display and edit JPEGs, PNGs, and BMPs in 24-bit truecolor where possible. Windows and Linux consoles support truecolor out of the box. "Terminal" built in to macOS only supports an 8-bit color display but iTerm2 on macOS supports truecolor.

Vimage focuses on general image manipulations such as resizing, cropping, flipping, rotating, splitting, and joining. It does not currently offer pixel-level editing.

`A`    | Apply Macro To All   | Applies the current command macro (recorded with `q`) to the current image and all images below.
`c`    | Crop Mode            | Enters Crop Mode. `[h,j,k,l]` crop 1 pixel off the left/bottom/top/right, respectively. `[H,J,K,L]` expands by one pixel, using the `:bg` color to fill the gap. `100j` crops 100 pixels off the bottom, etc. Tap `ESCAPE` to exit Crop Mode.
`d`    | Delete/Cut           | Deletes the current image and copies it to the clipboard.
`f`    | Flip Horizontal      | Flips (mirrors) the current image horizontally.
`F`    | Flip Vertical        | Flips (mirrors) the current image vertically.
`g`    | Go to First Image    | [Image List] Selects the first image in the image list.
       | Jump to Top          | [Zoom/Crop] Pans the image window to make the top side of the image visible.
`G`    | Go to Last Image     | [Image List] Selects the last image in the image list.
       | Jump to Bottom       | [Zoom/Crop] Pans the image window to make the bottom side of the image visible.
`j`,`k`| Next/Previous Image  | Selects the next or previous image in the Image List to view or edit.
`J`,`K`| Shift List Position  | Shifts the current image up or down in the Image List, reordering the list.

# Command Line Commands
Type `:` to begin a Command Line command. Type one of the following and then tap `ENTER` to execute or `ESCAPE` to cancel.

Command   | Arguments       | Description
----------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------
`:anchor`   | `[center\|top\|left\|bottom\|right]+`<br>`[c\|t\|l\|b\|r]+` | Sets the anchor used when when an image is cropped or expanded.
`:aspect`   | `[16:9\|3:4\|...]`  | Crops the image as necessary to achieve the specified aspect ratio.
`:aspect-fill` | `[WxH\|Wx\|xH]`     | Crops, expands, and/or resizes the current image to aspect-fill the specified size, retaining the same aspect ratio while completely filling the specified dimensions. Some content may be lost.
`:aspect-fit`  | `[WxH\|Wx\|xH]`     | Crops, expands, and/or resizes the current image to aspect-fit the specified size, retaining the same aspect ratio while fitting all content within the specified dimensions. The result may be letterboxed or pillarboxed.
`:bg`       | `[V\|RGB\|ARGB\|RRGGBB\|AARRGGBB]`<br>`[transparent\|white\|red\|...\|random]` | Sets the background color used for `:new` images and for expanded areas of an existing image.
`:clamp`    | `LOW HIGH`        | Limits the range each pixel's color components to the corresponding low and high of the specified ARGB values. For example, `clamp 048 FCA` limits each red component to the range 00-FF, each green component to 44..CC, and each blue component to 88..AA.
`:clamph`   | `HIGH`        | Equivalent to `:clamp 0000 HIGH`.
`:clampl`   | `LOW`         | Equivalent to `:clamp LOW ffff`.
`:copy`     | `[a\|r\|g\|b\|XX]` `[a\|r\|g\|b]+` | Copy the specified source channel (a,r,g,b) or a constant channel value (such as `7f`) to one or more destination channels. To copy red to green and blue channels: `:copy r gb`. See also: `:swap`.
`:crop`     | `WxH`             | Crop/expand to size WxH (e.g. `:crop 640x480`). If W and H are real numbers then they are treated as proportions - `:crop 0.5x2.0` crops half the width and expands to twice the height.
`:crop`     | `Wx`              | Crop/expand to width W, preserving the current height.
`:crop`     | `xH`              | Crop/expand to height H, preserving the current width.
`:crop`     | `N`               | Crop N pixels on all sides. If N is negative then sides are expanded instead.
`:crop`     | `LEFT TOP RIGHT BOTTOM` | Crop/expand the specified number of pixels on each side. `:crop 1 -2 0 1` crops the left and bottom by 1 pixel and expands the top by 2 pixels.
`:fill` | `COLOR`\<br>`LEFT RIGHT`<br>`TL TR BL BR`<br>`COLORS` | Fills the current image with a single color, a color gradient that uses either 2 side colors or 4 corner colors, or a horizontal color gradient that uses 3, 5, or more colors.
`:ha`       |                 | Toggle "hard alpha" view on or off. When hard alpha is on, any pixel that is not completely transparent is shown as completely opaque. This helps ensure that translucent pixels are not accidentally cropped off.
`:hsv2rgb`  |                 | The corollary to `:rgb2hsv`, this assumes the current image contains HSV color components and converts them to RGB color components.
`:join`     | `WxH`             | Join or splice the next W\*H images together in a WxH grid. Images are aspect-fit-resized as necessary so that all grid cells are a consistent size.
`:name`     | `<filename>`      | Renames the current image but does not save the renamed image.
`:new`      | `WxH`             | Creates a new image of the specified pixel size.
`:open`     | `<filepaths>`     | Opens one or more specified images and adds them to the Image List.
`:q`        |                 | Quits (closes) the current image. Will be unsuccessful if the image has modifications.
`:q!`       |                 | Quits (closes) the current image, even if it has modifications.
`:qq`       |                 | Quits all images and ends Vimage. Will be unsuccessful if any image has modifications.
`:qq!`      |                 | Quits all images, even if some of them have modifications.
`:resize`   | `[WxH\|Wx\|xH]`     | Resizes the current image. "Wx" and "xH" variations retain the current aspect ratio while specifying a new size for one dimension.
`:rgb2hsv`  |                 | Converts the current image's RGB color components into HSV (Hue Saturation Value, also called HSB or Hue Saturation Brightness) color components. Each pixel's "red" value now indicates hue (0-255), "green" is saturation (0-255), and "blue" is brightness (0-255). These channels can be further manipulated using commands such as `:&`, `:|`, and `:clamp`. Then the image can be converted back into RGB with the command `:hsv2rgb`.
`:rm`       |                 | Removes (deletes) the file for the current image from the filesystem. Useful for cleaning up an image folder by deleting unwanted images.
`:save`     | `[filepath]`      | An alias for `:w`.
`:split`    | `[WxH]`           | Splits the current image into W\*H images. For example, `:split 4x2` assumes the current image is 4 tiles wide and 2 tiles high and splits the image into 8 separate tile images.
`:swap`     | `[a\|r\|g\|b]` `[a\|r\|g\|b]` | Swaps one color channel with another in the current image. For example, `:swap r b` swaps the red and blue channels.
`:w`        | `[filepath]`      | Writes (saves) the current image, optionally specifying a new filepath.
`:wall`     |                   | Writes (saves) all modified images.
`:wq`       |                   | Writes (saves) and quits (closes) the current image.
`:&`        | `[V\|RGB\|ARGB\|RRGGBB\|AARRGGBB]` | Bitwise-AND's each pixel in the current image with the specified constant value.
`:\|`       | `[V\|RGB\|ARGB\|RRGGBB\|AARRGGBB]` | Bitwise-OR's each pixel in the current image with the specified constant value.
`:~`        | `[V\|RGB\|ARGB\|RRGGBB\|AARRGGBB]` | Bitwise-XOR's each pixel in the current image with the specified constant value.
`:<`        | `N`               | Left-rotates the RGB bits by N pixels. Does not affect the alpha bits. Example: `:< 8`.
`:<`        | `N a`             | Left-rotates the ARGB bits by N pixels. Example: `:< 8 a`.
`:>`        | `N`               | Right-rotates the RGB bits by N pixels. Does not affect the alpha bits. Example: `:> 8`.
`:>`        | `N a`             | Right-rotates the ARGB bits by N pixels. Example: `:> 8 a`.
