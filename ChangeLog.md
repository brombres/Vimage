# GameGUI Change Log

# v1.14

## Command Line Commands

- `:clamp` is now `:filter clamp`.
- `:clamph` has been removed (use `:filter clamp`).
- `:clampl` has been removed (use `:filter clamp`).
- `:hsv2rgb` is now `:filter hsvtorgb`.
- `:rgb2hsv` is now `:filter rgbtohsv`.

## Filters

### clamp

    :filter clamp <low-color> <high-color>

Limits the range of each pixel's color components to the corresponding low and high byte of the specified ARGB values. For example, `clamp 048 FCA` limits each red component to the range 00-FF, each green component to 44..CC, and each blue component to 88..AA.

### copy

    :filter copy [a|r|g|b|XX] [a|r|g|b]+

Copy the specified source channel (a,r,g,b) or a constant channel value (such as `7f`) to one or more destination channels. To copy red to green and blue channels: `:filter copy r gb`. See also: `:filter swap`.

### gray

    :filter gray
    :filter gray 299 587 114

- Now accepts RGB weight arguments.
- Weights are normalized. `:filter gray 1 2 1` and `:filter gray 0.25 0.50 0.25` are equivalent.

### hsvtorgb

    :filter hsvtorgb

Treats pixel RGB color components as HSV (likely from a prior `:filter rgbtohsv` conversion) and performs an HSVâ†’RGB conversion on them.

### normalize

    :filter normalize
    :filter normalize lowvalue highvalue

Normalizes brightness. The existing brightness range is remapped onto the full brightness range 0..255 or other specified range.

### rgbtohsv

    :filter rgbtohsv

Converts pixel RGB color components to HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) format. After the filter is applied, the Red component 0-255 indicates Hue 0-255, Green indicates Saturation, and Blue indicates Value. Use `:filter hsvtorgb` to perform the reverse conversion.

### swap

    :filter swap [a|r|g|b] [a|r|g|b]

Swaps one color channel with another. For example, `:filter swap r b` swaps the red and blue channels. See also: `:filter copy`.

## info

    :info range

Report image information. `range` reports the highest and lowest brightness values among an image's pixel RGB components, ranging from 0 to 255.
